# WellTrack — Your Personal Wellness Journal

## What is WellTrack?

WellTrack is a private, easy-to-use wellness tracking app built for people living with chronic health conditions. It gives you a single place to record how you feel each day — your symptoms, your mood, your medications, your habits — and then shows you the patterns over time so you can better understand your own health.

Think of it as a health journal that actually does something useful with your data.

## Who is it for?

WellTrack is designed for anyone who:

- Lives with a chronic illness (fibromyalgia, lupus, MS, Crohn's, POTS, long COVID, chronic migraines, or anything else that requires ongoing management)
- Wants to track how lifestyle factors like sleep, hydration, caffeine, or exercise affect how they feel
- Needs to bring meaningful data to doctor appointments instead of relying on memory
- Has tried paper journals or generic note apps and found them too slow or too disorganized
- Wants a calm, clear interface that doesn't require a lot of mental energy on hard days

## What problem does it solve?

Most people with chronic conditions struggle to answer their doctor's most basic question: _"How have you been feeling?"_

You might remember last Tuesday was bad, but not why. You might suspect that poor sleep makes your symptoms worse, but you have no proof. You arrive at appointments frustrated, under-prepared, and unable to advocate for yourself effectively.

WellTrack changes that. A 30-second daily check-in builds a detailed picture of your health over weeks and months — one you can actually review, filter, and export.

## Key Features

### Daily Logging — Fast and Low-Friction

Log a symptom in under 30 seconds. Rate severity from 1–10, add a note if you want, and you're done. The same quick process works for:

- **Symptoms** — choose from a built-in list or add your own; rate severity 1–10
- **Mood** — rate your mood, energy level, and stress on a 1–5 scale
- **Medications** — mark each medication as taken or skipped, log the time
- **Habits** — track sleep hours, water intake, exercise, caffeine, alcohol, or any custom habit you care about

You can also backfill past days if you forgot to log in the moment.

### Trend Charts — See the Patterns

WellTrack turns your daily check-ins into clear line charts showing how each symptom, mood metric, or habit has moved over 7, 30, or 90 days. You'll be able to answer questions like:

- "Does my fatigue spike on days I sleep less than 7 hours?"
- "Are my headaches getting better or worse this month?"
- "Is my mood trending up or down since I started this medication?"

A calendar heatmap shows you at a glance which days you logged, making it easy to spot gaps or streaks.

### History View — Your Full Record

Browse your complete log history, grouped by day. Filter by log type, click any entry to edit it, or delete entries you logged incorrectly. Nothing is permanent — you're always in control of your data.

### Customization — Built Around You

Everyone's health is different. WellTrack lets you:

- Show or hide any symptom from the built-in list
- Add your own custom symptoms and habits
- Manage your medication list (name, dosage, frequency)
- Set your timezone so all times are recorded correctly

### Data Export — Take Your Data Anywhere

Download a full CSV export of your logs at any time. Filter by date range and bring it to a doctor's appointment, share it with a specialist, or import it into another tool. Your data is yours.

## Privacy and Security

- **Your account is private.** No other users can see your data. WellTrack does not share your health data with advertisers, insurers, or any third parties.
- **Secure login.** Passwords are encrypted using industry-standard techniques. Login sessions use short-lived tokens that expire automatically.
- **Delete any time.** You can permanently delete your account and all your data from the Settings page. There's no waiting period and no hidden backups.

## Designed for Hard Days

Living with a chronic condition means some days it's hard to do much. WellTrack was designed with that in mind:

- The interface uses soft teal tones — no harsh colors, no clinical aesthetics
- Logging takes seconds, not minutes
- The layout works on your phone (375px and up) as well as on a desktop
- No ads, no notifications unless you want them, no gamification pressure

---

## Getting Started

1. Register with your email and a password
2. Set your timezone in Settings so logs are timestamped correctly
3. Add any medications you're tracking
4. Hide any built-in symptoms or habits you don't need
5. Start logging — even one check-in a day builds useful data over time

After a few weeks, visit the **Trends** page to start seeing patterns.
